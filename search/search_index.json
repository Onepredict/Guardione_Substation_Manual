You can check the list of transformers efficiently and search transformers with specific conditions. (1) Transformer Information List: The contents of the table includes the following information for integrated management: serial number, transformer tag, substation name, country, city, street, voltage(kV), capacity(kVA), one/three-phase, operating date, manufacturer, manufacturing date, and application. \u203b The unit for gas in this software is ppm. \u203b All dates in this software in yy/mm format. (2) Search Box: You can search the transformers by typing a specific information on the \u2018Search Box\u2019. Power Substation Monitoring This function provides summarized status of the selected transformers regionally in an aspect of spatial view, alarm rate, status diagram, and latest events. (1) Asset Tree Structure: A tree-like panel represents the transformers in a hierarchical structure and analysis methods of each transformer in the database. You can click a label to expand a node and reveal its hierarchy. If you select the specific country/city/street of transformer in the left tree-like panel, right map panel and other widget contents are changed to suit for the information in the selected area. When a specific transformer model is selected, the details of health information about the selected transformation are expanded. (2) Time Setting: The user can examine information through time zone using the time setting function. The time setting function can be set throughout the whole timeline. This means when the time set is applied, all pages will follow the set the user have made. The time settings are applicable in dates also. Followings are the instructions of how the time settings are enabled. (3) Spatial View: The panel shows the geographical distribution of transformer locations. As a default first display, a world map is provided. The user can zoom in and out from the world and specific city map by mouse wheel button or click , icon. The user also can click icon to maximize it to full-screen and click icon to reset map to north direction. The area with a red point is the country or region where the user has transformers. (4) Alarm Rate by Health Status: The panel shows the percentage of transformer at each health status by color-bar graph. \u203b Green: (Normal status) / Yellow : (Warning status) / Orange : (Critical status) / Red: (Fault status) (5) Status Diagram: The donut chart displays the number of transformers at each health status in the selected area. When you put the cursor on the chart, a pop-up displays the percentage of transformers in the corresponding status. The number centered on the donut chart means the total number of transformers in the selected area. In addition, the number of transformers at each health status is also displayed below the chart. (6) Latest Event: The panel updates the diagnosis result periodically. Briefly provides transformer tag, health status diagnosed by AI, and diagnosis date. (7) Event History: The table shows transformers\u2019 information in the selected region. The content includes substation name, serial number, transformer tag, voltage(kV), operating date, manufacturer, manufacturing date, DGA sampling date, and diagnosis/prognosis results. Clicking specific transformer tag in the table switches the dashboard into the description page about the corresponding transformer. Power Transformer Monitoring This screen covers the detailed information of the targeted transformer including trend analysis, industrial AI-based diagnosis and prognosis results, rule-based diagnosis results and summarized results from core features. Summary Information This function provides the latest analysis results of the transformer in brief. (1) Function Tree: When enter the individual transformer page, the function tree is displayed at the right panel. The panel includes a summary of the transformer information, AI, Rule related graphs and the setting tab for checking detailed information of the target transformer. (2) Fault Isolation: The panel shows fault components in 3D visual image. When the fault is detected on the transformer by Industrial AI-based diagnosis, the fault component is highlighted in the 3D model. (3) Comprehensive Predictive Diagnosis Result: The panel summarizes the predictive diagnosis results once the measured data are loaded. It provides the latest diagnosis results in reference to IEEE Std C57.104TM-2008 \u2018Dissolved key gas concentration limits\u2019 diagnostics standard. The fault mode evaluated by IEC 60599:2015 - Duval Triangle 1 method is also displayed, but it is inactivated in case there is no fault. In addition, the results of diagnosis and prognosis are displayed based on industrial-AI methods. (4) DGA Trend : The panel displays the concentration trends of the main six gases (H2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CO). If target transformer data has at least four continuous data and it is evaluated that the data is in error, the data provided in this dashboard is the calibrated data. When you put the cursor on a data point, the values of six gases are indicated by a pop-up window. (5) Health State Trend: The panel displays the entire health status (normal, warning, critical, fault) trend of the transformer, which allows users to understand the overall changes in transformer status. When you put the cursor on a data point, the detailed health status is indicated by a pop-up window. (6) DGA Similarity (Optional): Based on big data analysis, the panel shows the top three most similar transformers and the corresponding similarity. Users can check the status of the most similar transformers as a reference for the future status of the targeted transformer identification. The specific details about DGA similarity are illustrated in the \u2018Trend - Similarity Trend\u2019 page. Trend Analysis This function provides two main methods which is featured on trend analysis. One is gas trend analysis, descripting the transformer\u2019s status. The other is a DGA-based similarity trend analysis (optional), which also informs the status with comparing historical data with the most similar trends to the targeted transformer. Quick and immediate actions can be made through monitoring the status variation. Gas Trend Analysis This function offers three types of plots that represents gas characteristics intuitively. \u203b All DGA data provided on this dashboard are actual values. It is not a calibrated data value. (1) Gas Concentration Trend: The panel visually provides the whole gas DGA data throughout the time. The plotted gases are H2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CO, CO2, TDCG, C3H8, O2, N2, etc. The users can hide a gas trend by clicking the legend of the gas. When you put the cursor on a data point, the values of all selected gases are indicated by a pop-up window. (2) Key Gas Trend: In order to make it easier for the users to understand the correlation between the three key hydrocarbon gases (CH4, C2H4, C2H6), the panel shows 3D trend plot of the three gases over time.
