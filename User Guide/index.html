<h3 id="similarity-trend-analysis-optional">Similarity Trend Analysis (Optional)</h3>
<p>This function provides users with meaningful insights for predictive maintenance of transformers by presenting the most similar transformers. 
 <img alt="" src="./img/fig10.PNG" /></p>
<p><strong>(1)   DGA Similarity Trend:</strong> This figure are results of the health feature space. It showsthe trend of the targeted transformer in features values comparing with three transformers that have  the most similar status .  The values are variable in representing the status of the transformer. Industrial AI are applied to calculate the results. It is composed of two values and represents the x &amp; y axis in the figure. The DGA-based similarity analysis technique aims and finds the most similar transformer trend through four continuous feature values comparisons, so this figure provides the four feature values of the targeted transformer and the three transformers with the highest similarity. In addition, the fifth feature value of the three transformers with the highest similarity is also provided at the same time, thereby providing a reference value for understanding the future featured value of the targeted transformer. 
※ Red : (Targeted transformer) / Blue : (First similar transformer) / Yellow : (Second similar transformer) /  <br />
Green : (Third similar transformer) </p>
<p><strong>(2)   DGA Similarity Chart:</strong> The panel shows the top three most similar transformer tags and the corresponding similarity.</p>
<p><strong>(3)   DGA Trend:</strong> Click the ‘DGA Trend’ tab, the panel displays the main six gases of DGA (H2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CO) trend of three similar transformers and the targeted one. In addition, the highlighted part is the most similar gas value of three similar transformers comparing to the latest four measuring data of the targeted transformer. Therefore, the users can check the 5th set of data of three similar transformers as a reference for the targeted transformer. When you put the cursor on a point, a pop-up displays the values of six gases.</p>
<p><strong>(4)   Status Trend:</strong> By clicking the ‘Status Trend’ tab, the panel displays the status trend of three similar transformers and the targeted one’s status. Similar to the DGA Trend, the highlighted part is the most similar interval status, compared to the targeted transformer. In the same way, the users can check the 5th set of state of three similar transformers. This analytic method helps for a better understanding of the targeted transformer’s next health state. When you put the cursor on a point, a pop-up displays the very status at the moment.</p>
